## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Fix

### 1. Firestore API Not Enabled
**Error**: `Cloud Firestore API has not been used in project fr-toolv1 before or it is disabled`

**Solution**:
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fr-toolv1)
2. Navigate to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create database"
4. Choose "Start in test mode" for now (can change later)
5. Select a location (e.g., `us-central1`)
6. Click "Create"

**Alternative**: Use the direct link:
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/firestore.googleapis.com/overview?project=fr-toolv1

### 2. Cloud Functions Build Service Account Permissions
**Error**: `Build failed with status: FAILURE. Could not build the function due to a missing permission on the build service account`

**Solution**:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=fr-toolv1)
2. Find the service account ending with `@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Click the pencil icon to edit permissions
4. Add the following roles:
   - `Cloud Build Service Account`
   - `Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent`
   - `Cloud Functions Service Agent`

**Alternative**: Run this command in Google Cloud Shell:
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding fr-toolv1 \
  --member="serviceAccount:199413149840@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/cloudfunctions.serviceAgent"
```

## üöÄ Next Steps After Fixes

Once both issues are fixed, redeploy with:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## üì± Current Status
- **App URL**: https://fr-toolv1.web.app
- **Status**: Static site deployed (no SSR functions yet)
- **Database**: Not connected (Firestore API disabled)
- **Image Storage**: Ready for use

## üîß How to Test After Fixes
1. Visit https://fr-toolv1.web.app
2. Try adding a property URL to test image scraping
3. Check that images upload to Firebase Storage
4. Verify data saves to Firestore

## üìù Notes
- The static site should work for basic browsing
- Dynamic features (adding properties, image scraping) require the SSR function
- All Firebase Storage and Firestore security rules are deployed and ready
